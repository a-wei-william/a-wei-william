# Hi there! It's William here 🙂
 
I'm a pediatric resident passionate about leveraging AI/ML to enhance healthcare outcomes. With first-hand insight into the challenges faced in pediatric healthcare and a solid understanding of AI/ML fundamentals, I aim to champion the integration of AI/ML into healthcare. I am actively learning about the different AI/ML technologies that can be applied in healthcare.
